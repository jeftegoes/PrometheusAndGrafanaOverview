- Organizations rely more and more on telemetric data.
- Companies want to bring different data together.
- Telemetric data reside in different datasources.

## 1.4. Grafana

- Visualizes Time Series (telemetry) Data.
  - Time Series data has time stamps attached to it: One Order at 01/01/2022.
- Brings data from different datasources together.
- Defines alerts.
- Is extensible through plugins.

## 1.5. Alerts in Grafana

- Alerts are defined Graph Panel.
- Eachg Graph Panel can have one to many alerts.
- Alerts rise when a Rule is violated.
- A Rule indicates if a value on the graph is above or below a threshold.
- Rules are stored in and evaluated by Rule Engine.
